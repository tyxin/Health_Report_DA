    "    Air pollution can be factored by different kinds of air pollutants, namely particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), ground level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the environment. There are many factors to which an increase in respiratory related diseases can be brought about, therefore I would like to find out whether there is an impact and the extent different air pollutants worsens the health of people. Health of people can be defined as the number of cases of respiratory related diseases or mortality rate.\n",

    "    There are many respiratory related diseases such as respiratory infections, pulmonary heart disease and lung cancer which may be affected by air pollution to different extents. I would like to find out which respiratory related disease is the most adversely affected by air pollution if any (i.e. a small decrease in air quality can significantly increase the risk of having a particular respiratory related disease). \n",

However, with the advancement of society, there has been increased air pollution. Therefore, I want to find out how air quality effect on the health of people has varied across the past few years, whether the correlation (if any) between the number of respiratory related diseases and concentration of air pollutants is stronger or weaker across different years.\n",
